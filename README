SpazCore is a set of libraries that make it easier to create HTML+JavaScript
applications for desktop and mobile platforms. It's *not* a framework. It
primarily exists at this point to facilitate new versions of the Spaz Twitter
client on platforms other than AIR.

Generated API docs are available at http://funkatron.github.com/spazcore.
