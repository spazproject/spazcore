SpazCore is a set of libraries that make it easier to create HTML+JavaScript applications. It's *not* a framework. It 
primarily exists at this point to facilitate new versions of the Spaz Twitter client on platforms other than AIR.

SpazCore is not complete. It's barely started. If you're interested in JavaScript application development, SpazCore needs 
your help.

Here's what is planned at the moment:

* REQUIREMENTS: jQuery, JSON2.js
	* jQuery should be used in a non-conflicting manner at all times
* A comprehensive Twitter API Lib
* A preferences library
* A file access abstraction library
* A DB abstraction library (maybe ORM)
* A set of helper functions to make common tasks easier
	* Input filtering (security)
	* Strings
	* System and app data (versions, OS, etc)
	* File access
